    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Site</h1>

    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Firdous Popal</strong>, a Computer Science student at Holy Family University. I created this site to introduce myself, showcase my passions, and demonstrate my web development skills through an Agile-based project.</p>

    <p>This site was built using Django, HTML, and CSS — combining clean design with functionality. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> A personalized homepage</li>
      <li> An about section with my background and goals</li>
      <li> A working contact form that lets users send a message</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Everything here was developed and refined over multiple sprints using Agile methods — with improvements and testing at each stage.</p>

    <p><em>Thanks for visiting — feel free to explore and reach out!</em></p>
