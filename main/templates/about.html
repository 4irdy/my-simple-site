    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I'm <em>Firdous Popal</em>, a 21-year-old student from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. I’m currently majoring in Computer Science at Holy Family University, where I’m developing both my technical skills and creative approach to problem-solving.</p>

    <p>My journey into tech started with a love for video games and design — especially level building and immersive environments. I also enjoy photography, art, and storytelling, which fuel my interest in visual creativity and user-centered design.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Future game/level designer</li>
      <li> Passionate about photography and digital art</li>
      <li> Creative tech enthusiast with a strong eye for aesthetics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the future, I hope to work in the gaming industry, creating interactive experiences that blend storytelling, strategy, and design.</p>

    <p><em>Thanks for getting to know me — let’s build something awesome!</em></p>
